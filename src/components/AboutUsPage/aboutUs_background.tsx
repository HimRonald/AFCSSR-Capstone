                    <p className="text-base">
                        First of all, I would like to express my profound thanks to His or Her Excellency, Neak Oknha, ladies and gentlemen, and all the members of the former students' association who have supported me.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base">
                        In fact, without the will of former Cambodian students who used to study in the countries of the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, as well as Cambodian students currently studying in the Russian Federation, this association would not have emerged in 2019. Moreover, because we have the same values as people who love solidarity, promote friendship, embrace humanity, help one another, and protect each other's interests both physically and mentally—while also valuing education, research, science, and technology—it has brought us closer together in meaningful relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base">
                        The long journey of the association would not have been possible without its dream, shared by both existing and new members, to see it become an institution that plays an important role in humanitarian work, development, and the sharing and exchange of experiences, skills, technical standards, and culture between Cambodia, Russia, and the international community.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base">
                        To date, the association is now 5 years old. It may not be young, but since its first term, it has actively participated in helping alleviate the burdens of its members during times of need, engaging in humanitarian work with the Royal Government, and strengthening and expanding relationships among its members and with national and international partners. This includes working closely with embassies of former Soviet Union countries, exchanging knowledge, information, and experiences through workshops and discussions, and collaborating with the Royal Government, private sector, and local and foreign non-governmental organizations. Additionally, the association continues to promote the growth of knowledge in the Russian language.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base">
                        As the president of the association, I am deeply grateful for the presence of His or Her Excellency, Neak Oknha, Ladies, and Gentlemen, and your continued mental and financial support, which empowers this association to grow energetically and progress steadily.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base">
                        Solidarity, humanity, cooperation, and development will remain the guiding principles of the association and its members, helping it become a leading institution that thrives in the context of peace and security for all.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base">
                        With profound love from me,
